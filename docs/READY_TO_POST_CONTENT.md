🚀 From Physics to Code: My Journey into Software Engineering

I just published a new article on my blog about my career transition from studying physics to becoming a Full Stack Software Engineer through ALX.

It wasn't an easy journey, but every challenge taught me something valuable. From understanding quantum mechanics to debugging code, the skills I developed in physics gave me unique problem-solving perspectives that enhance my coding today.

Key lessons I learned:
✅ Embrace the unknown - every new technology feels intimidating at first
✅ Community matters - the developer community is incredibly supportive
✅ Build in public - sharing your progress helps you grow
✅ Your background is an asset - previous experience is a differentiator, not a hindrance

If you're considering a career change into tech, I hope my story inspires you!

**Tweet 1** (Main Tweet):
```
🚀 A year ago, I was studying physics. Today, I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer.

Here's how I made the transition from theoretical science to building real applications 🧵

👇
```

**Tweet 2**:
```
It started with a Python script for a physics simulation. That first moment of writing code that actually DID something - that produced visual results I could manipulate - was exhilarating.

I was hooked.
```

**Tweet 3**:
```
The logical thinking skills from physics translated perfectly:
• Problem decomposition
• Systematic debugging  
• Analytical reasoning

Physics taught me HOW to think. Programming taught me HOW to create.
```

**Tweet 4**:
```
I joined @alx_africa - an intensive 12-month program. It wasn't easy.

Challenges:
❌ Imposter syndrome
❌ Time management
❌ Steep learning curve

But the peer learning and project-based approach made all the difference.
```

**Tweet 5**:
```
Today I work with:
🐍 Python
⚡ JavaScript/Node.js
⚛️ React
🗄️ MongoDB
🚀 And more

Building full stack applications and loving every minute of it.
```

**Tweet 6**:
```
For anyone considering a career change into tech:

1. Start now (don't wait)
2. Build things (theory + practice)
3. Join communities (you're not alone)
4. Be patient (it takes time)
5. Your background is an asset ✨
```
