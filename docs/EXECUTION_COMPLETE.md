## 🔥 The Most Important Actions

1. **Google Search Console** - Request indexing
   - Impact: 🔥🔥🔥 CRITICAL
   - Time: 5 minutes
   - Result: Google indexes your site

2. **LinkedIn Profile Update** - Add portfolio link

**These 3 actions = 25 minutes = Massive SEO impact**

---

## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

1. **Do Search Console FIRST**: This is non-negotiable. Everything builds from here.

2. **Update LinkedIn TODAY**: Your LinkedIn probably already ranks for your name. Adding your portfolio link tells Google your site is important.

3. **Post consistently**: Better to post once a week for 3 months than every day for 1 week.

4. **Track everything**: You can't improve what you don't measure.

5. **Be patient**: SEO takes 8-12 weeks. The first month is laying foundation.

6. **Quality over quantity**: 1 great blog post > 10 mediocre ones.

7. **Engage authentically**: Build real relationships, not just backlinks.

---

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ **Not requesting indexing** - Site won't rank if Google doesn't know it exists
2. ❌ **Forgetting to update LinkedIn** - Missing easy high-authority backlink
3. ❌ **Spamming links** - Share genuinely, not everywhere
4. ❌ **Giving up too soon** - Results take 8-12 weeks minimum
5. ❌ **Not tracking progress** - You'll lose motivation without seeing growth
6. ❌ **Inconsistent posting** - Algorithm rewards consistency
7. ❌ **Ignoring engagement** - Respond to every comment
