## 🚫 Avoid These (Low Quality)

DO NOT pursue these backlinks (they can hurt SEO):

- ❌ Link farms
- ❌ Paid directory submissions (most are scams)
- ❌ Comment spam on blogs
- ❌ Irrelevant forums just for links
- ❌ Automated link building services
- ❌ PBNs (Private Blog Networks)
- ❌ Link exchanges (unless natural and relevant)

---

## 📊 Quality Metrics

For each backlink, consider:

**Good backlinks have:**
- ✅ High Domain Authority (40+)
- ✅ Relevant content/topic
- ✅ Natural link placement
- ✅ Do-follow link (preferred)
- ✅ Real traffic to that site
- ✅ Good reputation

**Warning signs:**
- ⚠️ Spammy-looking site
- ⚠️ No real content
- ⚠️ Site in wrong language/region
- ⚠️ Too many outbound links
- ⚠️ Low quality content

---

## 🔄 Link Status Codes

- 🔄 **In Progress** - Working on it
- ✅ **Active** - Link is live
- 📧 **Awaiting Response** - Reached out, waiting

## 💪 Pro Tips

1. **Quality > Quantity**: One link from Stack Overflow worth more than 50 from low-quality directories

2. **Diversify**: Mix of profile links, content links, mentions, social links

3. **Natural Pace**: Don't add 50 links in one day. Spread over time (looks more natural to Google)

4. **Anchor Text Variety**: 
   - "Brahim Elhouss" (50%)
   - "Full Stack Software Engineer" (20%)
   - "brahim-elhouss.me" (15%)
   - "Portfolio" (15%)

5. **Track Everything**: Even small wins matter. You'll want to see progress!

6. **Follow Up**: If you write guest post, share it! Each share = more visibility

7. **Relationships**: Build genuine relationships in communities. Natural backlinks follow.

**Next Steps**:
1. Start with LinkedIn and GitHub today
2. Add 2 new backlinks per day
3. Update this tracker weekly
4. Celebrate every new link! 🎉

**Remember**: Every backlink is a vote of confidence in your site. Build them ethically and consistently! 🚀
