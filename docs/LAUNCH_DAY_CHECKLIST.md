## 🎯 What to Track

### Check Every Monday:

1. **Google Search Console**:
   - Total impressions
   - Total clicks
   - Average position

2. **Rankings** (in incognito mode):
   - "Brahim Elhouss" → Position: ___
   - "Brahim Elhouss portfolio" → Position: ___

3. **Backlinks**:
   - Count how many you got this week

**Use**: `docs/SEARCH_RANKING_TRACKER.md`

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Don't Check Rankings Daily**: They fluctuate. Check weekly.

2. **Engage Before You Promote**: Comment on others' LinkedIn posts before posting your own.

3. **Respond to Every Comment**: Shows you're active and engaged.

4. **Be Patient**: SEO takes 8-12 weeks. First month is foundation building.

5. **Stay Consistent**: 1 hour daily beats 7 hours once a week.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see Request Indexing button"
- Make sure you're on the right property
- Make sure the URL starts with https://
- Wait for page to finish checking

### "My LinkedIn doesn't have Featured section"
