# Strategy: Rank for "Brahim Elhouss" / "Brahim El Houss" Alone

## 🎯 Goal
Make brahim-elhouss.me appear in **top 3 results** when people search ONLY your name, without additional keywords, competing directly with LinkedIn and Facebook.

## 🔥 Why This Is Harder Than Keyword + Name

### Simple Name Search:
- **"Brahim Elhouss"** → LinkedIn (DA 99), Facebook (DA 96), Instagram, Twitter all compete
- Google assumes user wants social profiles
- Much higher competition

### Name + Keyword Search:
- **"Brahim Elhouss portfolio"** → Less competition, your site is perfect match
- **"Brahim Elhouss developer"** → Clear intent, your site wins easily
- These are easier wins (and you'll get them faster)

## ✅ Strategy: Win BOTH Types of Searches

### Phase 1: Win Long-Tail First (Weeks 1-4)
Focus on searches where you have natural advantage:
- "Brahim Elhouss portfolio"
- "Brahim Elhouss software engineer"
- "Brahim Elhouss developer"
- "Brahim Elhouss Morocco"
- "Brahim Elhouss ALX"
- "Brahim Elhouss projects"
- "Brahim Elhouss full stack"

**Why**: These build authority and traffic, which helps simple name searches later.

### Phase 2: Build Authority (Months 2-3)
Use your long-tail rankings to boost overall domain authority:
- Get backlinks from tech blogs
- Create valuable content
- Engage in communities
- Build social proof

**Why**: Higher domain authority helps you compete with LinkedIn/Facebook.

### Phase 3: Dominate Simple Name Search (Months 4-6)
With established authority, push for simple name rankings:
- Consistent brand mentions across web
- Strong social signals
- Regular content updates
- High-quality backlinks
