- FAQ Schema with 8 questions
- Correct Open Graph type (profile)
- Fast page load (<200ms)

## Why Position 15?

The ranking is NOT due to technical issues. It's due to:
1. **Indexing time** - Changes need 2-4 weeks to be re-indexed
2. **Domain authority** - Need backlinks and social signals
3. **Competition** - Generic name queries have more competition

See `SEO-AUDIT-REPORT.md` for detailed recommendations.

## Troubleshooting

### Server Already Running
If you get "port already in use" error:
```bash
killall php
npx playwright test
```

### Tests Timing Out
Increase timeout in `playwright.config.js`:
```javascript
timeout: 60 * 1000  // 60 seconds
```

### Browser Not Installed
```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```
